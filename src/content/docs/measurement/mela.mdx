# WRI Internal Communications: MELA Framework

<div class="sl-markdown-content">
  <Card title="What is MELA?" icon="information">
    MELA stands for **Measurement, Evaluation, Learning, and Adaptation**â€”a simple framework for understanding whether your internal communications are working and how to improve them. This isn't about complex analytics or research studies; it's about building a habit of paying attention to results and making adjustments based on what you learn.

## Measurement: Track What Matters

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Basic Metrics">
    <CardGrid stagger>
      <Card title="Email Metrics" icon="document">

    <div class="sl-markdown-content">
      <Card title="Focus on Trends" icon="chart">
        Focus on trends rather than perfect benchmarks:
        - Are more people opening your emails over time?
        - Are meeting attendance rates consistent?
        - Are you getting fewer basic questions about previously communicated topics?

        These patterns tell you more than individual metrics.
      </Card>
    </div>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Getting Started">
    <Steps>
      1. Choose 2-3 metrics that align with your communication goals
      2. Determine what to track:
         - For awareness: focus on reach and engagement
         - For behavior change: look for action-based evidence
      3. Set up a simple tracking system:
         - Create a spreadsheet, or
         - Use existing platform dashboards
      4. Monitor metrics monthly
    </Steps>

## Evaluation: Make Sense of What You're Seeing

<div class="sl-markdown-content">
  <Card title="Looking Beyond Numbers" icon="open-book">
    The most valuable insights come from qualitative signals:
    - Are people asking sophisticated follow-up questions?
    - Are they using communication concepts in meetings?
    - Are managers reporting improved team understanding?
    
    These "soft" indicators often matter more than click-through rates.
  </Card>
</div>

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Monthly Check-In Questions" icon="list-format">
    - What communication received the best response and why?
    - What generated confusion or pushback?
    - What feedback are you hearing in informal settings?
    - What would you do differently next time?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Feedback Collection Methods" icon="puzzle">
    - Add quick feedback questions to communications
    - Leverage existing channels (surveys, town halls)
    - Conduct informal stakeholder follow-ups

## Common MELA Mistakes to Avoid

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Over-measuring" icon="warning">
    <Icon name="error" size="1.5rem" />
    Don't track every possible metric. Focus on a few key indicators that matter most to your goals.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Ignoring Qualitative Data" icon="document">
    <Icon name="error" size="1.5rem" />
    Numbers tell only part of the story. Value conversations and observations as much as metrics.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Delayed Adjustments" icon="clock">
    <Icon name="error" size="1.5rem" />
    Make continuous small improvements instead of waiting for formal evaluation periods.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Working in Silos" icon="people">

    Share your insights and learn from others' experiences to improve collective effectiveness.
