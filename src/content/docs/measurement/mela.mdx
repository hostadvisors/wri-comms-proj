<Aside type="note" title="What is MELA?">
MELA stands for **Measurement, Evaluation, Learning, and Adaptation**. It's a simple framework for understanding whether an internal comms initiative is working and how to improve future work. Integrating MELA into your workflow builds a habit of paying attention to results and making adjustments based on what you learn.

<Steps>

1. **Measurement: Track What Matters**

   When deciding on a measurement framework, focus on trends rather than perfect benchmarks. These patterns tell you more than individual metrics.

   <Aside type="tip" title="Key Questions to Ask">
   - Are more people opening your emails over time?
   - Are meeting attendance rates consistent?
   - Are you getting fewer basic questions about previously communicated topics?
   </Aside>

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem label="Digital Metrics">
   **Email Analytics (ContactMonkey)**
   - Open rates and trends
   - Click-through rates
   - Reply engagement
   - Forward/share activity

   **Newsletter Performance**
   - Read completion rates
   - Feedback volume and quality
   - Subscription growth/retention
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Engagement Metrics">
   **Meeting Analytics**
   - Attendance numbers and consistency
   - Participation levels during sessions
   - Quality of questions and discussions

   **Banyan Platform Engagement**
   - Content views and reach
   - Comments and reactions
   - Discussion thread participation
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. **Evaluation: Make Sense of What You're Seeing**

   The most valuable insights come from qualitative signals, which can help shape numeric data and illuminate trends. In fact, these "soft" indicators often matter more than click-through rates.

   <Aside type="caution" title="Qualitative Indicators to Watch">
   - Are people asking sophisticated follow-up questions?
   - Are they using communication concepts in meetings?
   - Are managers reporting improved team understanding?
   </Aside>

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem label="Regular Check-ins">
   **Monthly Evaluation Questions**
   - What communication received the best response and why?
   - What generated confusion or pushback?
   - What feedback are you hearing in informal settings?
   - What would you do differently next time?
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Feedback Collection">
   **Systematic Feedback Methods**
   - Add quick feedback questions to communications
   - Leverage existing channels (surveys, town halls)
   - Conduct informal stakeholder follow-ups
   - Monitor unsolicited feedback and conversations
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

3. **Learning: Turn Insights into Knowledge**

   To complete the feedback loop, document your successes as well as what didn't quite work as well. This provides the foundation for a reusable playbook of successful tactics.

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem label="Documentation Areas">
   **Key Areas to Reflect On**
   - Timing strategies and optimal scheduling
   - Channel effectiveness for different audiences
   - Messaging approaches that resonate
   - Format choices and presentation styles
   - Stakeholder engagement patterns
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Learning Process">
   **From Challenges to Improvements**
   1. Identify what didn't work as expected
   2. Analyze potential causes:
      - Message clarity and relevance
      - Channel selection appropriateness
      - Timing decisions and context
      - Audience alignment and targeting
   3. Document lessons learned systematically
   4. Develop concrete improvement strategies
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   <Aside type="tip" title="Knowledge Sharing">
   Share insights with colleagues, connect with the Global Internal Communications Team, and exchange regional best practices to amplify learning across the organization.
   </Aside>

4. **Adaptation: Improve Based on What You Learn**

   Small changes can lead to significant improvements. The key is continuous monitoring and iterative adjustments rather than waiting for major overhauls.

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem label="Quick Adjustments">
   **Immediate Improvements**
   - **Email engagement issues** → Try different subject lines or timing
   - **Low meeting attendance** → Modify format, duration, or schedule
   - **Content ineffectiveness** → Refine messaging approach or format
   - **Poor feedback quality** → Adjust question framing or collection method
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Experimentation Framework">
   **Systematic Testing Approach**
   1. **Start small** with low-risk communications
   2. **Test new formats** (videos, infographics, interactive content)
   3. **Try different channels** (email, Banyan, meetings, informal)
   4. **Experiment with timing** (morning vs. afternoon, weekly vs. monthly)
   5. **Scale successful approaches** to more important initiatives
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   <Aside type="note" title="Continuous Improvement Strategy">
   Build checkpoints into communication plans, assess effectiveness regularly, make iterative improvements, and don't wait for campaign end to adjust your approach.
   </Aside>

</Steps>
## Best Practices & Common Pitfalls

<Aside type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
Begin with low-risk communications for experiments. Once you find what works, apply these proven approaches to more important initiatives.
</Aside>

### What to Avoid

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Measurement Mistakes">
**Over-measuring Everything**
- Don't track every possible metric
- Focus on 3-5 key indicators that matter most to your goals
- Quality of insights matters more than quantity of data

**Ignoring Timing Context**
- Consider external factors affecting engagement
- Account for seasonal patterns and organizational cycles
- Don't compare metrics across dramatically different periods
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Evaluation Errors">
**Ignoring Qualitative Data**
- Numbers tell only part of the story
- Value conversations and informal feedback as much as metrics
- Look for patterns in anecdotal evidence

**Delayed Response to Issues**
- Make continuous small improvements
- Don't wait for formal evaluation periods to act
- Address obvious problems immediately
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Learning & Adaptation Issues">
**Working in Silos**
- Share your insights with colleagues
- Learn from others' experiences regularly
- Participate in global communications best practice sharing

**Fear of Experimentation**
- Don't stick with approaches just because they're familiar
- Test new methods systematically
- Accept that some experiments won't work as expected
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
