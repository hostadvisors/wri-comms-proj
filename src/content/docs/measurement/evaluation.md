# Measurement & Evaluation

Effective measurement helps us understand the impact of our internal communications, optimize our approaches, and demonstrate value to organizational leadership.

## Measurement Philosophy

### Purpose-Driven Metrics
Measurement should align with communication objectives and organizational goals. We measure to:
- **Improve performance**: Identify what works and what doesn't
- **Demonstrate value**: Show impact on organizational objectives

- **Support decision-making**: Provide data for strategic choices

### Balanced Approach
Our measurement framework balances:
- **Quantitative data**: Metrics and analytics
- **Qualitative insights**: Feedback and observations
- **Short-term indicators**: Immediate response and engagement
- **Long-term outcomes**: Behavior change and organizational impact
