# WRI Internal Communications: How to Measure Communication Effectiveness

## Start Simple: Basic Engagement Metrics

Measuring your internal communications doesn't have to be complicated. Start with basic metrics that are already available through your communication tools. ContactMonkey provides email open rates, click rates, and read times. Banyan shows post views and engagement. Meeting attendance numbers tell you if people are showing up to all-staff gatherings. Stream views indicate whether people are watching recorded sessions. These numbers give you a baseline understanding of whether people are seeing and engaging with your content.

## Look for Trends, Not Perfect Numbers

Don't get caught up in achieving specific metric targets or comparing yourself to external benchmarks. Internal communications data has limitations—high open rates don't guarantee understanding, and low engagement might reflect timing rather than content quality. Instead, focus on trends over time. Are open rates increasing or decreasing? Is meeting attendance consistent? Are people asking fewer questions about topics you've communicated repeatedly? These patterns tell you more about effectiveness than individual data points.

## Pay Attention to Soft Metrics

The most valuable insights often come from qualitative signals that numbers can't capture. Notice the types of questions you're receiving—are they asking for basic information you thought you'd already communicated clearly, or are they asking sophisticated follow-up questions that show understanding? Pay attention to how people discuss topics in meetings or informal conversations. Are they using the language and concepts from your communications? Are they taking the actions you intended? These soft metrics often provide better insights than click-through rates.

## Create Opportunities for Feedback

Build feedback collection into your communication process rather than treating it as an afterthought. Send brief post-implementation surveys after major communications or changes to understand what worked and what didn't. Include specific questions in your communications asking what people need more information about. Use existing feedback mechanisms like engagement pulse surveys, culture surveys, or Staff Assembly town halls to ask about communication effectiveness. Make it easy for people to share concerns or suggestions through dedicated channels.

## Simple Ways to Gather Insights

You don't need sophisticated research to understand how your communications are working. Try these straightforward approaches:

- **Ask direct questions** in follow-up emails: "What questions do you have about this change?"
- **Include feedback requests** in newsletters: "What topics would you like more information about?"
- **Monitor informal channels** like Teams chats or hallway conversations for questions or confusion
- **Follow up with key stakeholders** after major communications to understand their perspective
- **Track support requests** to see if communication gaps are creating extra work for help desks or managers

## Focus on What Matters Most

Remember that the goal of measurement is improvement, not perfection. Choose a few key indicators that align with your communication goals and track them consistently. If you're trying to increase awareness, monitor reach and engagement metrics. If you're driving behavior change, look for evidence that people are taking desired actions. If you're building understanding of complex topics, pay attention to the quality of questions and feedback you receive. Good measurement helps you learn what's working so you can do more of it and identify what needs adjustment.

## Getting Started

Start by identifying one or two simple metrics that matter for your specific communication goals, then add feedback collection to your regular communication process. Most importantly, create a habit of reflecting on both the numbers and the qualitative signals you're receiving. This combination of quantitative and qualitative insights will give you a clear picture of how well your communications are serving the WRI community.
