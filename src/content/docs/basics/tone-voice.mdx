Using one voicehelps our communications remain consistent and recognizable. These guidelines are an overview of how to speak in this voice, which we call the "Citizen".


**What is the Citizen voice?**

The Citizen archetype represents our commitment to being reliable, inclusive, and genuinely helpful to our WRI community. This voice reflects our values of respect, integrity, and collective action—speaking to everyone as valued members of our organization.

**Our communications should embody the following core values:**
- Reliability and trust
- Inclusivity and respect
- Practical and solution-focused
- Transparency and honesty
