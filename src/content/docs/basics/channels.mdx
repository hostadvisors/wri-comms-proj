# Channel Deep Dive
## Email

Email is best used for for direct, documented communication that requires immediate attention or more formal record-keeping. Too many emails can get overwhelming or ignored, so use this tool strategically rather than as a catch-all.

- Keep subject lines clear and actionable
- Use bullet points for key information
- Include clear next steps or deadlines
- Consider timing for different time zones
