## Understanding Archetypes in Communication

Effective communication relies on consistent personality and voice that audiences can recognize and trust. Carl Jung's theory of 12 universal archetypes provides a framework for developing this consistency. These archetypes represent fundamental human motivations and behaviors that resonate across cultures and contexts.

<Aside type="note" title="Jung's 12 Archetypes">
**The 12 Universal Archetypes:**
- **Innocent** (optimism, faith) - *"Things will work out"*
- **Everyman/Citizen** (belonging, connection) - *"We're all in this together"*
- **Hero** (courage, determination) - *"Where there's a will, there's a way"*
- **Caregiver** (service, compassion) - *"Love your neighbor as yourself"*
- **Explorer** (freedom, adventure) - *"Don't fence me in"*
- **Rebel** (revolution, change) - *"Rules are made to be broken"*
- **Lover** (passion, relationships) - *"You're the only one"*
- **Creator** (innovation, imagination) - *"If it can be imagined, it can be created"*
- **Jester** (joy, humor) - *"You only live once"*
- **Sage** (wisdom, intelligence) - *"The truth will set you free"*
- **Magician** (transformation, vision) - *"I make things happen"*
- **Ruler** (control, responsibility) - *"Power isn't everything, it's the only thing"*
</Aside>

## Why the Citizen Archetype for Internal Communications?

The Citizen (also known as Everyman) archetype is particularly powerful for internal organizational communication because it embodies the core values essential for building trust and community within a workplace.

<Steps>

1. **Creates Belonging and Inclusion**
   
   The Citizen archetype speaks to our fundamental need to belong to something meaningful. In internal communications, this translates to messages that make every team member feel valued and included, regardless of their role, location, or tenure.

2. **Builds Trust Through Relatability**
   
   Unlike authoritative archetypes (Ruler) or visionary ones (Magician), the Citizen speaks as an equal among peers. This creates trust because the communication feels genuine and non-manipulative.

3. **Emphasizes Collective Success**
   
   The Citizen archetype naturally focuses on "we" rather than "I" or "they." This reinforces that organizational success depends on everyone working together toward shared goals.

4. **Balances Stability with Progress**
   
   Internal communications must often balance the need for change with the desire for stability. The Citizen archetype can advocate for necessary changes while providing reassurance about core values and commitments.

5. **Resonates Across Cultures**
   
   For a global organization like WRI, the Citizen archetype's emphasis on universal human needs—belonging, fairness, mutual support—transcends cultural differences more effectively than more culturally specific archetypes.

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip" title="Why Not Other Archetypes?">
- **Hero** might sound too self-promoting or create pressure
- **Sage** could come across as academic
- **Ruler** might feel authoritarian or top-down
- **Caregiver** could sound paternalistic
- **Citizen** strikes the right balance of competence, humility, and connection
</Aside>

Using one voice helps our communications remain consistent and recognizable. These guidelines are an overview of how to speak in this voice, which we call the "Citizen".

<Aside type="note" title="What is the Citizen Voice?">
The Citizen archetype represents our commitment to being reliable, inclusive, and genuinely helpful to our WRI community. This voice reflects our values of respect, integrity, and collective action—speaking to everyone as valued members of our organization.

## Style Tips for Citizen Voice

In addition to the Style Book guidance, think about the following as you write.

<Steps>

1. **Eliminate Development Jargon**
   
   Write as if you're communicating with a professional from another field. Avoid all jargon, especially "consultant-speak."
   
   <Tabs>
   <TabItem label="Instead of Jargon">
   - "We'll help you implement this change" *(not "facilitate operationalization")*
   - "Let's improve our approach" *(not "optimize our strategic framework")*
   - "We're working together on this" *(not "leveraging cross-functional synergies")*
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Common Jargon to Avoid">
   - Leverage, utilize, operationalize, strategize
   - Best practices, synergies, bandwidth, bandwidth
   - Low-hanging fruit, move the needle, circle back
   - Paradigm shift, game-changer, transformational
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. **Use Simple, Direct Language**
   
   If you can say something with fewer words or simpler words with the same meaning, do so.
   
   <Aside type="tip" title="Word Choice Guide">
   - Say "use" not "utilize"
   - Say "help" not "facilitate"
   - Say "improve" not "enhance"
   - Say "start" not "commence"
   - Say "end" not "terminate"
   </Aside>

3. **Avoid Aggrandizing Adverbs**
   
   Be careful with adverbs that try to make things sound more impressive. Often removing them makes writing more direct and trustworthy.
   
   <Tabs>
   <TabItem label="Remove These Adverbs">
   - "Extremely important" → "Important"
   - "Highly effective" → "Effective" 
   - "Very excited" → "Pleased" or "Ready"
   - "Incredibly valuable" → "Valuable"
   - "Absolutely essential" → "Essential"
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Why This Matters">
   Excessive adverbs can make writing sound:
   - Less credible and trustworthy
   - More marketing-oriented than informational
   - Like you're trying too hard to convince
   - Breathless and overwhelming
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

4. **Use Active Voice**
   
   Express ownership over what we say, do, and have done. Use passive voice only when active would sound very awkward.
   
   <Tabs>
   <TabItem label="✅ Active Voice Examples">
   - "We are implementing new policies" 
   - "The team completed the project"
   - "Our research shows..."
   - "We learned valuable lessons"
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="❌ Passive Voice to Avoid">
   - "New policies are being implemented"
   - "The project was completed"
   - "It has been shown that..."
   - "Lessons were learned"
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

5. **Help the Reader**
   
   Vary sentence lengths and structures. Avoid the temptation to add more words, even if they sound clever.
   
   <Aside type="caution" title="Remember">
   Clear always beats clever. Your goal is understanding, not impressing.
   </Aside>

6. **Don't Avoid Contractions**
   
   Contractions sound clearer and more trustworthy than formal alternatives.
   
   <Tabs>
   <TabItem label="✅ Use Contractions">
   - "We don't expect any major issues"
   - "You won't need to change your current process"
   - "It's important to understand..."
   - "We're committed to transparency"
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="❌ Overly Formal">
   - "We do not expect any major issues"
   - "You will not need to change your current process"
   - "It is important to understand..."
   - "We are committed to transparency"
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

7. **Edit Your Own Writing**
   
   <Aside type="tip" title="Two-Step Editing Process">
   1. **Read aloud**: Read what you've written out loud to catch awkward phrasing and run-on sentences
   2. **Get a second pair of eyes**: Always have someone else do a final copy edit—it's nearly impossible to catch all errors in your own writing
   </Aside>

</Steps>
