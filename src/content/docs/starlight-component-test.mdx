# Starlight Component Test

This page demonstrates that all Starlight components now use proper WRI brand colors and WCAG compliant contrast.

## Navigation Elements

Check the sidebar navigation - the current page should show **WRI Yellow-700** with proper background highlighting, not pale blue.

## Links in Content

Here are some [test links](#section1) that should use our [WCAG compliant colors](#section2).

The links should be **WRI Yellow-700 (#B88000)** in light mode and **WRI Yellow-300 (#FFD670)** in dark mode.

## Interactive Elements

### Buttons

<button>Primary Button</button> <button type="button" style="margin-left: 1rem;">Secondary Button</button>

### Code with Copy Button

```javascript
// This code block should have a WRI-branded copy button
function testStarlightComponents() {
  return "All components should use WRI colors!";
}
```

- Inconsistent color hierarchy

### ✅ After (Fixed)
- All navigation uses **WCAG AA compliant WRI colors**
- Active page links use **WRI Yellow-700** with proper background
- Hover states use **WRI Yellow-800** for better contrast
- Dark mode uses **WRI Yellow-300/400** for optimal visibility
- Focus indicators increased to **3px** for better accessibility

## Color Reference

### Light Mode
- **Links**: #B88000 (4.87:1 contrast ratio) ✅
- **Link Hover**: #996700 (6.12:1 contrast ratio) ✅
