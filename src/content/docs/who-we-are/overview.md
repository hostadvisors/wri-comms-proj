description: Internal Communications roles and responsibilities across WRI
---

As WRI's Internal Comms Network, we work together cross-functionally to ensure that everyone across WRI, regardless of role or location, is informed, aligned, and connected to our mission and each other. 

- **Our vision:** WRI's internal communications help staff feel **engaged, aligned & well-informed** so we can contribute effectively to our mission for people, nature & climate.

- **Our approach:** We do this by reinforcing strategic priorities, supporting change initiatives, clarifying policies, reflecting and strengthening culture, and highlighting our collective impact. For more info, see Target 5 in [Comms 5-Year Strategy](https://onewri.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/Banyan2/Strategy/EdAiqWIN_HZGkxJUqb3RytkBFPv7exwEcf2tUrUTi1PuCQ?e=HmwpDA)

For tools and resources to launch campaigns, see [Channels & Methods]().

- **Teams**: Shared workspace on MS teams

- **Monthly calls**: A space for sharing resources, aligning on messaging for key rollouts, and supporting each other across regions
- **Office hours**: Open space for questions, discussion, or learning more about internal comms functions
