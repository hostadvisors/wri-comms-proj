description: Internal Communications roles and responsibilities across WRI
---

As WRI's Internal Comms Network, we work together cross-functionally to ensure that everyone across WRI, regardless of role or location, is informed, aligned, and connected to our mission and each other. 

- **Our vision:** WRI's internal communications help staff feel **engaged, aligned & well-informed** so we can contribute effectively to our mission for people, nature & climate.

- **Our approach:** We do this by reinforcing strategic priorities, supporting change initiatives, clarifying policies, reflecting and strengthening culture, and highlighting our collective impact. For more info, see Target 5 in [Comms 5-Year Strategy](https://onewri.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/Banyan2/Strategy/EdAiqWIN_HZGkxJUqb3RytkBFPv7exwEcf2tUrUTi1PuCQ?e=HmwpDA)

## Members of our network

We're made up of a **global** team as well as **regional**, **country**, and **program** staff working together toward a common goal. These teams include defined Internal Comms roles as well as other staff who may have different primary functions, but still have internal comms responsibilities in their work.

Our work at the global, local, and program levels approaches the same goal, but from different angles. 

### Global Internal Comms team
As the center point of the global network for Internal Comms, we work in sync with country, regional, and program teams and staff to distill important messaging and ensure strategies work in practice for each context.

### **Country, regional, and Program internal comms teams**

Each country or regional office, and each Program at a global level, shapes internal comms for their respective local or programmatic audience. This includes not only addressing team-specific needs not met by broader global comms, but also contextualizing information and change for local team needs. 

| Function | Goal |
| -------- | ------- |
| Strategy              | Set internal comms strategy for country/regional office  |
| Messaging             | Communicate about country strategy, impact, policies, change initiatives to local internal audience. Adapt global messaging for local relevance and context    |
| Channels              |  Manage local communication channels (e.g., local Banyan site, newsletter, local Teams channel, office-wide staff meetings)    | 
| Coordination          | Facilitate two-way comms with global to surface staff voices and feedback. Liaise with the global team to highlight local announcements and achievements    |
| Measurement           | Track local internal comms effectiveness through surveys and analytics  |

For tools and resources to launch campaigns, see [Channels & Methods]().

- **Teams**: Shared workspace on MS teams
