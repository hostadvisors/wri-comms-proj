## Purposed local team structure
It is recommended that each country or regional office and each Program at a global level has one Internal Communications employee. In cases where this is not possible, then it is advised that the core activities of the function are delegated to other employees. This role commonly reports to the country communications lead with a dotted line to the global internal communications lead, although other reporting structures may apply, such as in the case for Programs.

- Ensure effective dissemination of global and local announcements, following a cascading framework (see cascading chart)
- Maintain and update content on Banyan, ensuring accurate and relevant content. This may involve overseeing and supporting other local Banyan content owners.
- Contribute to internal crisis communications, ensuring timely and effective messaging
- Monitor both formal and informal channels to stay informed about key updates, staff needs and sentiment
- Act as a liaison with the global Internal Communications team, providing updates on key local announcements and organizational changes

### Other desired functions
