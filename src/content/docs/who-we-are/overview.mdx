As WRI's Internal Comms Network, we work together cross-functionally to foster a culture of impact, accountability, inclusion and wellbeing, while promoting WRI as a great place to work. Through robust internal communications, our aim is that everyone across WRI, regardless of role or location, is informed, aligned, and connected to our mission and each other. 


- **Our vision:** WRI's internal communications help staff feel **engaged, aligned & well-informed** on WRI’s strategy and impact, leadership and governance, and journey to organizational excellence so we can contribute effectively to our mission for people, nature & climate.

- **Our approach:** We do this by reinforcing strategic priorities, supporting change initiatives, clarifying policies, reflecting and strengthening culture, and highlighting our collective impact.

## Our Network

We're made up of a **central** team as well as **regional**, **country**, **Core Functions**, and **Program** staff working together toward a common goal. These teams include defined Internal Comms roles as well as other staff who may have different primary functions, but still have internal comms responsibilities in their work.

Our work at the central, local, Core Functions, and Program levels approaches the same goal, but from different angles. 

### Central Internal Comms Team
As the center point of the global network for Internal Comms, we work in sync with country, regional, Core Functions, and Program teams and staff to distill important messaging and ensure strategies work in practice for each context.

| Function | Goal |
| -------- | ------- |
| Strategy              | Oversee, deevelop and own the overall internal comms strategy, guidelines and standards    |
| Messaging             | Lead on global announcements, leadership comms, crisis comms, and major internal campaigns. Provide messaging guidance and toolkits    |
| Channels              |  Oversee and maintain central channels and platforms (See [Channels](/channels/channels))    | 
| Coordination          | Manage the central comms calendar and support the global IC network    |
| Measurement           | Track the central and overall internal comms effectiveness through surveys and analytics  |

### **Country, Regional, Core Functions, and Program Teams**

Each country or regional office, and each Core Function and Program team at a global level, shapes internal comms for their respective defined audience. This includes not only addressing team-specific needs not met by broader central comms, but also contextualizing information and tailoring campaigns for their defined audiences needs. 

| Function | Goal |
| -------- | ------- |
| Strategy              | Set internal comms strategy for their defined audience  |
| Messaging             | Communicate about local/core/programmatic strategy, impact, policies, change initiatives to their identified internal audience. Adapt central messaging for local relevance and context    |
| Channels              |  Manage local or otherwise delimited channels (e.g., a local banyan site, a program-owned internal newsletter, a core functions teams channel, office-wide staff meetings, etc.)    | 
| Coordination          | Facilitate two-way comms with the central internal comms team to surface staff voices across the network and feedback. Liaise with the central team to highlight local announcements and achievements    |
| Measurement           | Track internal comms effectiveness on their defined audience through surveys and analytics  |
