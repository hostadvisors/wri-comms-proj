Country and regional offices should hold periodical all-staff meetings to inform them about important developments across the institute and as touch points with staff.
- Ideally, local all-staff meetings should be held monthly or quarterly at minimum
- All-staff meetings should have an in-person component when possible
- The purposed length is 60 to 90 minutes
- There should be a host of the meeting (usually the local CEO or a local core functions or program director)
- The topics of the meeting and the run-of-show should be agreed on preferably a month to two weeks in advance
- The invitation to the meeting should be send as soon as possible to hold the space on people’s calendar (please refer to this all-staff meeting invite [template]())
- The meeting usually is divided into three parts:
    - Opening remarks by the host
    - Main segment (a major policy announcement, a new program launch, etc.)
    - House-keeping announcements
