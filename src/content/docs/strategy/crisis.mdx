Crisis communications is the strategic management of information during urgent, high-stakes situations that threaten an organization's reputation, operations, or mission. For WRI, effective crisis communication ensures transparency, maintains stakeholder trust, and demonstrates our commitment to accountability while protecting our ability to continue vital environmental work.

## Why Crisis Communications Matter at WRI

As a global environmental organization, WRI faces unique crisis scenarios that require specialized communication approaches. Our work spans sensitive political environments, controversial policy areas, and rapidly evolving environmental emergencies. Effective crisis communication:

- **Protects organizational credibility** essential for policy influence and funding
- **Maintains stakeholder trust** across diverse audiences (donors, partners, governments)
- **Ensures mission continuity** during challenging periods
- **Demonstrates transparency** consistent with WRI's values
- **Provides accurate information** to counter misinformation about environmental issues

## Types of Crises WRI May Face

1. **Research Integrity Issues**
   
   Data accuracy questions, methodology challenges, or peer review concerns that could undermine WRI's scientific credibility.

2. **Partnership Controversies**
   
   Conflicts involving corporate partners, government relationships, or coalition dynamics that may affect WRI's reputation or operations.

3. **Environmental Emergencies**
   
   Natural disasters, environmental accidents, or urgent policy responses requiring immediate WRI expertise and communication.

4. **Internal Operational Issues**
   
   Staff safety incidents, workplace misconduct, or organizational challenges that require transparent internal and external communication.
