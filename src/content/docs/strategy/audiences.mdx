**Identify key internal audiences**—by team, region, role, or function—and consider their specific needs, concerns, and context. Ask:
- What does this audience need to do, know or feel as a result of your message?
- How familiar are they with the topic or change?
- What tone, language, or framing will resonate most?

Tailor your objectives for each group (e.g., awareness, behavior change, alignment) to ensure your message lands with relevance and impact (examples)
