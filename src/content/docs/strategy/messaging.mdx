## The Four-Part Messaging Framework

<Aside type="tip">
  Every effective internal message should address four key components that help people understand and respond appropriately. This framework ensures your communication is complete and actionable, whether you're announcing a policy change, launching a new initiative, or updating the organization on progress.
</Aside>

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Context: Why This Matters" icon="information">
    Start by explaining why you're communicating and what you're trying to achieve. Help people understand the bigger picture and how this connects to WRI's mission and goals.
    
    **Ask yourself:**
    - What problem are we solving?
    - What's the desired outcome?
    - How does this support our organizational priorities?

    :::tip[Example]
    "To better serve our mission of climate action, we're strengthening our approach to..."
    :::
  </Card>

  <Card title="Change: What's Happening" icon="setting">
    Clearly describe what is changing, being launched, or happening. Be specific about what's different from the current state and avoid jargon.
    
    **Ask yourself:**
    - What exactly is new or different?
    - What will people notice changing?

    :::tip[Example]
    "Starting in January, all project reports will use the new template and approval process..."
    :::
  </Card>

  <Card title="Impact: What This Means for You" icon="user">
    Explain the specific implications for each group, including key dates, milestones, or deadlines they should know about.
    
    **Ask yourself:**
    - How does this affect different teams or roles?
    - What should people expect and when?
    - What concerns might they have?

    :::tip[Example]
    "For program staff, this means you'll have a new dashboard to track project metrics. Regional offices will receive training materials by March 15..."
    :::
  </Card>

  <Card title="Action: What You Need to Do" icon="right-arrow">
    End with clear, specific next steps. Tell people exactly what you need them to do, by when, and where they can get help.
    
    **Ask yourself:**
    - What specific actions are needed?
    - When is the deadline?
    - Who can they contact?

    :::tip[Example]
    "Complete the online training module by February 28. Contact the Help Desk at [email] with technical questions or reach out to your manager about process questions."
