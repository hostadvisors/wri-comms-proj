**Core messaging should consider context, change, impact, and action.** Standardized, defined components help us understand what works and what doesn't for future campaigns and helps us tailor messaging to audience.

Make it meaningful: What do you want your audiences to do, know or feel?
- **Context:** Why we’re doing this (including desired outcome / vision of WRI post-change) 
- **Change:** What’s changing 
- **Impact:** What it means for you (including tailored points for different audiences) + what to expect (key dates and milestones)  
- **Action:** What you need to do (clear call to action if relevant); where to find resources & raise questions / share feedback
