## The Four-Part Messaging Framework

Every effective internal message should address four key components that help people understand and respond appropriately, whether you're announcing a policy change, launching a new initiative, or updating teams on a project's progress.

<Steps>

1. **Context: Why This Matters**
   
   Start by explaining why you're communicating and what you're trying to achieve. Help people understand the bigger picture and how this connects to WRI's mission and goals.
   
   <Aside type="tip" title="Ask Yourself">
   - What problem are we solving?
   - What's the desired outcome?
   - How does this support our organizational priorities?
   </Aside>
   
   **Example:** "To better serve our mission of climate action, we're strengthening our approach to..."

2. **Change: What's Happening**
   
   Describe what is changing, being launched, or happening. Be specific about what's different from the current state and avoid jargon.
   
   <Aside type="tip" title="Ask Yourself">
   - What exactly is new or different?
   - What will people notice changing?
   </Aside>
   
   **Example:** "Starting in January, all project reports will use the new template and approval process..."

3. **Impact: What This Means for You**
   
   Explain the specific implications for each group, including key dates, milestones, or deadlines they should know about.
   
   <Aside type="tip" title="Ask Yourself">
   - How does this affect different teams or roles?
   - What should people expect and when?
   - What concerns might they have?
   </Aside>
   
   **Example:** "For program staff, this means you'll have a new dashboard to track project metrics. Regional offices will receive training materials by March 15..."

4. **Action: What You Need to Do**
   
   End with specific next steps. Tell people exactly what you need them to do, by when, and where they can get help.
   
   <Aside type="tip" title="Ask Yourself">
   - What specific actions are needed?
   - When is the deadline?
   - Who can they contact?
   </Aside>
   
   **Example:** "Complete the online training module by February 28. Contact the Help Desk at [email] with technical questions or reach out to your manager about process questions."

</Steps>

## Making Your Messages Meaningful

Focus on what you want people to think, feel, or do after receiving your communication. Every message should pass these four essential tests to ensure it truly serves your audience.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Relevant">
**Does this connect to what people care about in their work?**

Your message should clearly relate to something that matters to your audience's daily responsibilities, career goals, or work challenges. If the connection isn't obvious, explain it.

- Link new information to current projects or priorities
- Explain how this affects their specific role or department
- Connect organizational changes to individual impact
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Clear">
**Can someone unfamiliar with the topic understand what you're asking?**

Test your message with colleagues who aren't close to the subject. If they're confused, your broader audience will be too.

- Use simple, direct language without jargon
- Define terms that might be unfamiliar
- Structure information logically from most to least important
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Complete">
**Have you addressed the context, change, impact, and action?**

Don't leave people guessing about important details. Include everything they need to understand and respond appropriately.

- Provide sufficient background for decision-making
- Include all relevant dates and deadlines
- Offer multiple ways to get help or more information
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Compelling">
**Does this motivate people to pay attention and respond appropriately?**

Your message should create the right level of urgency and engagement without being overwhelming or dramatic.

- Lead with the most important information
- Use concrete examples and specific benefits
- Make the next steps feel manageable and worthwhile
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Tailoring for Different Audiences

The same core message may need different emphasis for different groups. Make sure your communication is framed correctly based on your target audience and their specific needs and concerns.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Leadership">
**Focus on strategic rationale and resource implications**

Leaders need to understand how this fits into the bigger picture and what it means for organizational priorities and resources.

- Emphasize strategic alignment with WRI's mission and goals
- Include budget, timeline, and staffing considerations
- Explain potential risks and mitigation strategies
- Connect to organizational performance metrics and outcomes
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Program Teams">
**Provide detailed implementation guidance and timeline information**

Program staff need practical information they can act on immediately to maintain project momentum and deliverables.

- Include step-by-step implementation instructions
- Provide specific deadlines and milestone dates
- Explain how this affects current project timelines
- Offer templates, tools, and resources for immediate use
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Support Functions">
**Explain operational changes and new processes**

Support teams (HR, IT, Finance, Admin) need to understand how this changes their daily operations and what new processes they need to implement.

- Detail new procedures and workflow changes
- Explain system updates or technology requirements
- Provide training schedules and support resources
- Include compliance and reporting requirements
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Regional Offices">
**Include guidance on local adaptation and rollout**

Regional teams need to understand how to adapt global guidance to local contexts while maintaining consistency with organizational standards.

- Provide flexibility guidelines for local adaptation
- Include cultural and regulatory considerations
- Explain coordination requirements with headquarters
- Offer region-specific timelines and support contacts
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Quick Messaging Checklist

This framework works for everything from brief email updates to comprehensive campaign messaging. Start with these four components, and your communications will be clearer, more complete, and more likely to drive the results you need.

<Steps>

1. **Context: Why This Matters**
   - Explain why you're communicating and what you're trying to achieve
   - Connect this to WRI's mission and organizational goals
   - Help people understand the bigger picture and strategic importance

2. **Change: What's Happening**
   - Describe what specifically is changing, being launched, or happening
   - Be specific about what's different from the current state
   - Use clear, jargon-free language that everyone can understand

3. **Impact: What This Means for You**
   - Explain specific implications for different teams and roles
   - Include key dates, milestones, and deadlines people need to know
   - Address anticipated concerns and questions proactively

4. **Action: What You Need to Do**
   - Provide clear, specific next steps with concrete deadlines
   - Include contact information for questions and support
   - Make the required actions feel manageable and achievable

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip" title="Remember">
Before sending any message, ask yourself: "Would someone reading this for the first time understand what they need to know and do?" If the answer is no, revisit your four components and add the missing information.

## Advanced Messaging Considerations

Once you've mastered the four-part framework, consider these additional factors to make your communications even more effective:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Timing Strategy">
**When you send matters as much as what you send**

- **Plan around organizational rhythms**: Avoid busy periods like budget season or major project deadlines
- **Consider global time zones**: Schedule important announcements when most regions can respond
- **Sequence related messages**: Space out connected communications to avoid overwhelming people
- **Allow processing time**: Give people adequate time to understand before expecting action
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Channel Selection">
**Match your message to the right platform**

- **Email**: For formal announcements, policy changes, and documented decisions
- **Teams**: For collaborative discussions, quick updates, and team coordination
- **All-staff meetings**: For complex topics requiring Q&A and real-time discussion
- **Banyan**: For community building, resource sharing, and ongoing conversations
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Feedback Integration">
**Build in opportunities for response and improvement**

- **Ask specific questions**: "What concerns do you have about this timeline?"
- **Provide multiple response channels**: Email, Teams, office hours, surveys
- **Follow up on feedback**: Show how input influenced decisions or address why suggestions weren't implemented
- **Create feedback loops**: Regular check-ins to assess how communications are working
