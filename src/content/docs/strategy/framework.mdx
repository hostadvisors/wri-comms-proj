## Step 1. Start with the Basics

A strong communications plan starts with some key definitions. By documenting a shared understanding of success, timelines, and KPIs, all team members involved will have the resources necessary to ground their work.

<Steps>
1. **Define Success Metrics**
   - Clearly outline what success looks like for your communication effort
   - Check alignment with WRI's organizational priorities
   - Set specific, measurable goals
   - Set timeline expectations
   - Establish feedback mechanisms

2. **Identify Communication Type**
   - New initiative launch
   - Policy changes
   - Strategic progress updates
   - Organizational changes
   - Crisis comms
</Steps>

## Step 2. Know Your Audience

Defining your audience helps move comms from general to targeted, ensuring that information is framed in a relevant context. If you're unsure where to start or still feel you need to narrow down your targeted audience more, use the following questions as a guide.

:::tip[Key Questions to Consider]
- How familiar is each audience with the topic?
- What are their potential concerns?
- What specific actions do they need to take?
- What level of detail is appropriate?
:::

Here are some possible goals for different audience types. Consider these as you define your core audience and message.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Senior Leadership">
  **Needs to know:**
    - High-level strategic overview
    - Impact on organizational goals
    - Resource implications
    - Key decision points
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Program Staff">
    **Needs to know:**
    - Detailed implementation guidance
    - Day-to-day impact
    - Process changes
    - Impending actions
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Regional Offices">
    **Needs to know:**
    - Cultural adaptations
    - Timeline adjustments
    - Regional specific actions
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>



## Step 3. Develop Clear Messaging

We can use four simple questions to guide the development of an impactful message. 

Following this framework also allows for teams to connect metrics and outcomes to specific steps for future improvement and potential replication.

<Steps>
1. **Context (Why?)**
   - **Explain the background of your message/campaign.** Where did this idea or need come from?
   - **Connect to organizational goals.** How does this help further WRI's mission?
   - **Highlight the need for change.** How will people, processes, or results be improved?

2. **Change (What?)**
   - **Describe the specific changes.** Use specific, concrete examples relevant to your audience/
   - **Outline the implementation process.** Dates and timelines are helpful.
   - **Provide clear examples.** Allow people to see what this will look like in practice.

3. **Impact (So What?)**
   - **Outline effects on different groups.** Think about how this may impact colleagues working outside of internal comms as well.
   - **Address potential concerns.** Possibly provide a Q&A or office hours for additional support.
   - **Highlight benefits.** What about the work process might become easier?

4. **Action (Now What?)**
   - **List required steps.** Simple, clear, and reasonable asks.
   - **Provide resources.** Share key points of contact or relevant templates/trainings.
   - **Set clear expectations.** Let colleagues know they are not expected to handle things alone; we are a team.
</Steps>

## Step 4. Choose the Right Channels

| --- | --- | --- |
| Email | Urgent updates | Time-sensitive information |
| All-staff meetings | Complex topics | Discussions and Q&A |
| Banyan | Ongoing conversations | Regular updates |
| Newsletters | Regular updates | Periodic summaries |
:::

<Steps>
1. **Plan Your Timeline**
   - **Awareness building phase.** Socialize through appropriate channels.
   - **Engagement and feedback period.** The bulk of the campaign occurs here.
   - **Implementation support.** Build in time to offer support if necessary.
   - **Ongoing reinforcement.** Collecting feedback and making adjustments as necessary.

2. **Consider Timing**
   - **Start early to avoid surprises.** Build in time for technical difficulties or unexpecteed delays.
   - **Account for different time zones.** Keep in mind international holidays that may impact other teams.
   - **Plan for key organizational events.** Ensure your comms fit in with the WRI-wide comms schedule.

</Steps>

## Step 5. Track Your Impact

Monitoring and evaluation goes beyond just numbers. To understand the impact of your communications initiative, consider using several channels to gauge audience response and align future communications.
