**Effective internal communication starts with a plan.** A strong strategy ensures that your messages support organizational goals, reach the right audiences, and drive the right actions. Whether you are developing an annual plan or planning a specific campaign, the same core principles apply:
- **Define your goals:** Clarify what success looks like, ensuring alignment with WRI’s and your team’s strategic priorities. 
- **Know your audiences:** Identify key internal audiences and understand what each group needs to know, feel and do. Be specific about your comms objectives for each audience.
- **Craft clear messaging:** Develop a core narrative and tailor messages to resonate with key audiences
- **Choose the right channels:** Use a mix of formats—such as email, staff meetings, Banyan, Teams, and toolkits—to reach people where they are and reinforce key messages.
- **Build your timeline:** For long-term strategies, create a flexible calendar that maps out key themes and organizational moments. For campaigns, identify key milestones and engagement points.
- **Track your impact:** Establish metrics to measure progress against your goals, and adjust your approach as needed.
