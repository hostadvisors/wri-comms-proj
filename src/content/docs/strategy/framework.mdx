**Effective internal communication starts with a plan.** A strong strategy ensures that your messages support organizational goals, reach the right audiences, and drive the right actions. Whether you are developing an annual plan or planning a specific campaign, the same core principles apply:
- **Define your goals:** Clarify what success looks like, ensuring alignment with WRI’s and your team’s strategic priorities. 
- **Know your audiences:** Identify key internal audiences and understand what each group needs to know, feel and do. Be specific about your comms objectives for each audience.
- **Craft clear messaging:** Develop a core narrative and tailor messages to resonate with key audiences
- **Choose the right channels:** Use a mix of formats—such as email, staff meetings, Banyan, Teams, and toolkits—to reach people where they are and reinforce key messages.
- **Build your timeline:** For long-term strategies, create a flexible calendar that maps out key themes and organizational moments. For campaigns, identify key milestones and engagement points.
- **Track your impact:** Establish metrics to measure progress against your goals, and adjust your approach as needed.

**Identify key internal audiences**—by team, region, role, or function—and consider their specific needs, concerns, and context. Ask:
- What does this audience need to do, know or feel as a result of your message?
- How familiar are they with the topic or change?
- What tone, language, or framing will resonate most?

Tailor your objectives for each group (e.g., awareness, behavior change, alignment) to ensure your message lands with relevance and impact (examples)




Effective internal communication starts with a strategic plan. Whether you are developing an annual strategy or planning a specific campaign, the same core principles apply.

## Start With a Plan

**Effective internal communication starts with a plan.** A strong strategy ensures that your messages support organizational goals, reach the right audiences, and drive the right actions.

### Core Strategic Principles

- **Define your goals**: Clarify what success looks like, ensuring alignment with WRI's and your team's strategic priorities
- **Know your audiences**: Identify key internal audiences and understand what each group needs to know, feel and do. Be specific about your comms objectives for each audience
- **Craft clear messaging**: Develop a core narrative and tailor messages to resonate with key audiences
- **Choose the right channels**: Use a mix of formats—such as email, staff meetings, Banyan, Teams, and toolkits—to reach people where they are and reinforce key messages
- **Build your timeline**: For long-term strategies, create a flexible calendar that maps out key themes and organizational moments. For campaigns, identify key milestones and engagement points
- **Track your impact**: Establish metrics to measure progress against your goals, and adjust your approach as needed

## Audiences & Objectives

### Identifying Key Internal Audiences

Identify key internal audiences—by team, region, role, or function—and consider their specific needs, concerns, and context.

**Key Questions to Ask:**
- What does this audience need to do, know or feel as a result of your message?
- How familiar are they with the topic or change?
- What tone, language, or framing will resonate most?

### Setting Clear Objectives

Tailor your objectives for each group (e.g., awareness, behavior change, alignment) to ensure your message lands with relevance and impact.

**Example Objectives:**
- **Leadership**: Understand strategic rationale and be able to communicate key messages to their teams
- **Program Staff**: Know how changes affect their daily work and project delivery
- **Support Functions**: Understand operational implications and new processes
- **Regional Offices**: Adapt global messaging for local context and implementation

## Messaging Framework

### Core Messaging Components

**CONTEXT**: Why we're doing this (including desired outcome / vision of WRI post-change)

**CHANGE**: What's changing

**IMPACT**: What it means for you (including tailored points for different audiences) + what to expect (key dates and milestones)

**ACTION**: What you need to do (clear call to action if relevant); where to find resources & raise questions / share feedback

### Making It Meaningful

Focus on what you want your audiences to do, know or feel. Ensure messages are:
- **Relevant**: Connected to audience needs and context
- **Clear**: Easy to understand and actionable
- **Consistent**: Aligned across all communications
- **Compelling**: Motivating and engaging

## Channels & Tactics

Choose the right mix of communication channels based on:
- **Audience preferences**: How does each group prefer to receive information?
- **Message complexity**: Does the content require detailed explanation or quick updates?
- **Timing needs**: Is this urgent, routine, or strategic communication?
- **Feedback requirements**: Do you need two-way dialogue or one-way information sharing?

### Channel Selection Guide

Refer to the [What We Do](/foundation/what-we-do/) section for detailed channel guidelines and best practices.

## Communicating Change

Change communications require special attention to address resistance, build understanding, and drive adoption.

### Change Communication Principles

1. **Start early**: Begin communications before changes are finalized to build awareness and gather input
2. **Be transparent**: Share the why behind changes, including challenges and expected benefits  
3. **Address concerns**: Anticipate questions and resistance, providing honest responses
4. **Provide support**: Offer resources, training, and assistance to help people adapt
5. **Celebrate progress**: Acknowledge milestones and recognize successful adaptation

### Change Communication Timeline

- **Phase 1 - Awareness**: Build understanding of the need for change
- **Phase 2 - Engagement**: Involve stakeholders in planning and feedback
- **Phase 3 - Implementation**: Support adoption with clear guidance and resources
- **Phase 4 - Reinforcement**: Maintain momentum and address ongoing challenges

## Cascading Information

*Framework in progress: Connect, Communicate, Contextualize. Matrix on who can cascade what. Open to new terminology and approach – this is one of our greatest needs*

### Cascading Framework

Effective cascading ensures that important information flows consistently through the organization while allowing for local adaptation and context.

**Connect**: Ensure leadership alignment before cascading begins
**Communicate**: Deliver consistent core messages through appropriate channels
**Contextualize**: Allow local teams to adapt messaging for their specific audience needs

## Tracking Success

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Basic engagement metrics**: ContactMonkey open/click/read rates
- **Platform analytics**: Banyan traffic, Stream views, staff meeting attendance
- **Response tracking**: Survey completion rates, feedback volume

### Qualitative Measures
- **Feedback quality**: Depth and nature of questions and comments
- **Behavioral indicators**: Changes in how people discuss or act on information
- **Sentiment tracking**: Overall tone and reception of communications

### Creating Feedback Opportunities

- **Post-implementation surveys**: Gather feedback after major communications or changes
- **Pulse surveys**: Regular check-ins on communication effectiveness
- **Focus groups**: Deep-dive discussions with key stakeholder groups
- **Open forums**: Town halls, Q&A sessions, and listening sessions

### Limitations and Insights

Recognize the limitations of data and focus on drawing insights from trends rather than individual metrics. Soft metrics and qualitative feedback often provide the most valuable insights for improvement.
