## Start with the Basics

Effective internal communication starts with a clear plan that connects your messages to organizational goals. Before writing anything, define what success looks like for your communication effort. Are you launching a new initiative, announcing policy changes, or updating the organization on strategic progress? Your goals should align with WRI's priorities and be specific enough that you'll know when you've achieved them.

## Know Your Audience and What They Need

Identify who needs this information and what each group specifically needs to know, feel, or do as a result. Your message for senior leadership will be different from what program staff or regional offices need to hear. Ask yourself: How familiar is each audience with this topic? What concerns might they have? What action do you need them to take? Tailor your objectives for each group—some may need detailed implementation guidance while others just need awareness of changes coming their way.

## Develop Clear, Consistent Messaging

Create a core narrative that explains the context (why this matters), the change (what's happening), the impact (what it means for different audiences), and the action (what people need to do next). Your messaging should be relevant to each audience, clear enough for non-experts to understand, and consistent across all communications. Focus on making your message compelling by connecting it to what people care about in their daily work.

## Choose the Right Channels and Timing

Select communication channels based on your audience preferences, message complexity, and timing needs. Use email for urgent updates, all-staff meetings for complex topics requiring discussion, Banyan for ongoing conversations, and newsletters for regular updates. For major changes, plan a timeline that allows for awareness-building, engagement and feedback, implementation support, and ongoing reinforcement. Start early enough that people aren't surprised by changes.

## Track Your Impact and Adjust

Establish simple metrics to measure whether your communication is working—this might include email open rates, meeting attendance, feedback volume, or survey responses. More importantly, pay attention to qualitative signals like the types of questions you're getting, how people are discussing the topic, and whether they're taking the actions you need. Create opportunities for feedback through surveys, focus groups, or open forums, and be prepared to adjust your approach based on what you learn.
