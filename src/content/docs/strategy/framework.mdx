# Communications Strategy Framework

Effective internal communications start with a clear strategy. This framework will help you develop communications that are purposeful, targeted, and measurable.

## The WRI Communications Strategy Model

### **1. Define Purpose & Objectives**

**Why are you communicating?**
- Inform: Share information or updates
- Engage: Build participation and involvement  
- Influence: Change attitudes or behaviors
- Inspire: Motivate and energize teams

**What specific outcomes do you want?**
- Increased awareness of [specific topic]
- Higher participation in [specific initiative]
- Behavior change around [specific practice]
- Improved understanding of [specific concept]

### **2. Know Your Audience**

**Primary Audience**: Who must receive this message?
**Secondary Audience**: Who else might be interested or influenced?
**Key Influencers**: Who can amplify your message?

**For each audience, consider:**
- Current knowledge level
- Information preferences
- Communication channel preferences
- Potential barriers or resistance
- Motivations and interests

### **3. Craft Your Core Message**

**Single Core Message**: What's the one thing you want audiences to remember?

**Supporting Messages**:
- Why this matters to them
- What action you want them to take
- How this connects to WRI's mission

**Message Testing Questions**:
- Is it clear and understandable?
- Is it relevant to the audience?
- Is it credible and trustworthy?
- Is it actionable?

### **4. Select Channels & Tactics**

**Channel Selection Criteria**:
- Where does your audience prefer to receive information?

- What resources do you have available?
- How urgent is your message?

**Common Internal Channels**:
- Email (newsletters, announcements)
- Intranet and digital workplace
- Town halls and meetings
- Slack and instant messaging
- Video and multimedia content

### **5. Create Timeline & Resources**

**Timeline Planning**:
- When does your audience need this information?
- How much lead time do you need for content creation?
- What's the optimal timing for maximum engagement?
- How will you sequence multiple touchpoints?

**Resource Requirements**:
- Content creation time
- Design and multimedia needs
- Translation requirements

- Follow-up and measurement

### **6. Measure & Evaluate**

**Success Metrics**:
- **Reach**: How many people saw your message?
