# WRI Brand Voice Guidelines

WRI's brand voice is the consistent personality that comes through in all our communications. It reflects who we are as an organization and helps build trust and recognition with our internal audiences.

## Our Brand Voice

### **Authoritative yet Accessible**
We speak with the confidence that comes from rigorous research and deep expertise, but we make complex topics understandable for all audiences.

**✅ Do**: "Our latest research shows that sustainable forest management can reduce carbon emissions by 30%."  
**❌ Don't**: "Studies suggest there might be some environmental benefits to forest management."

### **Optimistic yet Realistic**
We maintain hope about environmental solutions while acknowledging the scale and urgency of the challenges we face.

**✅ Do**: "While climate change presents unprecedented challenges, innovative solutions are emerging worldwide."  
**❌ Don't**: "Climate change is an insurmountable problem with no clear solutions."

### **Collaborative yet Leading**
We position ourselves as thought leaders while emphasizing partnership and shared responsibility.

**✅ Do**: "Together with our partners, we're developing breakthrough solutions for sustainable cities."  
**❌ Don't**: "WRI is the only organization capable of solving urban sustainability challenges."

### **Urgent yet Thoughtful**
We communicate the pressing nature of environmental issues while demonstrating careful analysis and strategic thinking.

**✅ Do**: "The next decade is critical for climate action—our roadmap provides a clear path forward."  
**❌ Don't**: "We must act immediately without any planning or consideration."

## Voice Characteristics

### **Professional**
- Use clear, precise language
- Avoid jargon unless necessary (and always define it)
- Maintain appropriate formality for the audience

### **Human**
- Write in active voice when possible
- Use "we," "our," and "us" to create connection
- Show personality while maintaining professionalism

### **Solution-Oriented**
- Focus on opportunities and actionable next steps
- Frame challenges as opportunities for innovation
- Provide clear guidance and direction

### **Globally Minded**
- Consider diverse cultural perspectives
- Use inclusive language
- Avoid region-specific references unless contextually relevant

## Applying Our Voice

### **In Different Contexts**

**Executive Communications**: More formal, strategic focus, data-driven  
**Team Updates**: Conversational but professional, action-oriented  
**All-Hands Messages**: Inspiring, inclusive, mission-focused  
**Crisis Communications**: Clear, transparent, reassuring yet honest

### **Common Voice Mistakes to Avoid**

❌ **Too Academic**: Overly complex language that excludes audiences  
❌ **Too Casual**: Informal tone that undermines our expertise  
❌ **Too Pessimistic**: Focusing only on problems without solutions  
❌ **Too Promotional**: Sounding like marketing rather than authentic communication

## Voice Examples by Communication Type

### **Announcement**
"We're excited to share that our climate finance team has secured $50M in new funding to expand renewable energy access in Southeast Asia. This milestone reflects the power of our collaborative approach and positions us to reach 2 million additional people with clean energy by 2025."

### **Update**
"Q3 program results are in, and I'm pleased to report strong progress across our key initiatives. While we're seeing excellent momentum in forest restoration (exceeding targets by 15%), we're focusing additional resources on our cities program to accelerate progress in the final quarter."

### **Call to Action**
"The annual sustainability summit is your chance to connect with colleagues working on similar challenges across different regions. Registration closes Friday—secure your spot to join discussions that will shape our strategy for 2026."
