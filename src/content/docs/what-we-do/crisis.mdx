# Employee Journey Communications

Strategic internal communications should follow employees throughout their entire journey at WRI, creating meaningful connections and consistent engagement from their first interaction to their final farewell.

## The WRI Employee Journey Framework

This framework maps critical communication moments that shape the employee experience and create opportunities for deeper engagement with our mission.

### **🎯 Journey Stages**

1. **Pre-Boarding**: First impression and preparation
2. **Onboarding**: Integration and foundation building  
3. **Career Development**: Growth and learning opportunities
4. **Recognition & Milestones**: Celebrating achievements and service
5. **Transitions & Changes**: Navigating organizational shifts
6. **Offboarding**: Respectful closure and alumni relationships

### **📍 Key Communication Touchpoints**

Each stage includes multiple touchpoints that, when executed well, create a cohesive narrative of belonging, growth, and purpose at WRI.

## Why This Matters

**For Employees**:
- Creates predictable, supportive communication experiences
- Demonstrates WRI's investment in their journey
- Provides clear information when they need it most
- Builds stronger connection to mission and culture

**For WRI**:
- Improves retention and engagement
- Strengthens employer brand
- Creates consistent experiences across global offices
- Builds alumni network and ambassadors

**For Teams**:
- Reduces ad-hoc communication requests
- Provides tested templates and workflows
- Ensures nothing falls through the cracks
- Creates scalable processes

## Communication Principles for Employee Journey

### **Personalized**
Tailor messaging to the individual's role, office, and experience level while maintaining consistency.

### **Timely**
Deliver information when employees need it, not when it's convenient for us.

### **Relevant**
Focus on what matters most to them at each stage of their journey.

### **Connected**
Link each touchpoint to WRI's larger mission and their role in advancing it.

### **Two-Way**
Create opportunities for feedback and dialogue, not just information delivery.

## Journey Mapping Template

For each touchpoint, consider:

**📅 When**: Timing relative to employee milestone  
**👥 Who**: Sender and recipient(s)  
**📝 What**: Key messages and information  
**📱 How**: Channel and format  
**🎯 Why**: Purpose and desired outcome  
**📊 Measure**: Success metrics and feedback loops  

## Global Considerations

**Cultural Adaptation**: While maintaining core messaging, adapt tone and examples for local contexts.

**Time Zones**: Plan communication timing for global workforce.

**Language**: Ensure translations maintain WRI's voice while being culturally appropriate.

**Local Practices**: Incorporate regional customs around recognition, transitions, and celebrations.

## Integration with HR Systems

**Automated Triggers**: Connect communications to HR milestones and data.

**Personalization Data**: Use employee information to customize messaging.

**Feedback Integration**: Connect journey communications to engagement surveys and retention data.

**Compliance**: Ensure all communications meet local employment law requirements.
