This section provides guidance on navigating organizational shifts (role changes, restructuring, etc.) through effective communication.

Rather than jumping straight into an email, use the tools below to craft the strategy and delivery of this critical content.

### Start With a Plan

**Effective internal communication starts with a plan.** A strong strategy ensures that your messages support organizational goals, reach the right audiences, and drive the right actions. Whether you are developing an annual plan or planning a specific campaign, the same core principles apply:
- **Define your goals:** Clarify what success looks like, ensuring alignment with WRI’s and your team’s strategic priorities. 
- **Know your audiences:** Identify key internal audiences and understand what each group needs to know, feel and do. Be specific about your comms objectives for each audience.
- **Craft clear messaging:** Develop a core narrative and tailor messages to resonate with key audiences
- **Choose the right channels:** Use a mix of formats—such as email, staff meetings, Banyan, Teams, and toolkits—to reach people where they are and reinforce key messages.
- **Build your timeline:** For long-term strategies, create a flexible calendar that maps out key themes and organizational moments. For campaigns, identify key milestones and engagement points.
- **Track your impact:** Establish metrics to measure progress against your goals, and adjust your approach as needed.
[Include sample plan, template] 
[Maybe: rollout at a glance, adapted version of policy rollout checklist doc – or use this in appendix] 

### Audiences & Objectives
**Identify key internal audiences**—by team, region, role, or function—and consider their specific needs, concerns, and context. Ask:
- What does this audience need to do, know or feel as a result of your message?
- How familiar are they with the topic or change?
- What tone, language, or framing will resonate most?

Tailor your objectives for each group (e.g., awareness, behavior change, alignment) to ensure your message lands with relevance and impact (examples)

### Messaging
**Core messaging should consider context, change, impact, and action.** Standardized, defined components help us understand what works and what doesn't for future campaigns and helps us tailor messaging to audience.

Make it meaningful: What do you want your audiences to do, know or feel?
- **Context:** Why we’re doing this (including desired outcome / vision of WRI post-change) 
- **Change:** What’s changing 
- **Impact:** What it means for you (including tailored points for different audiences) + what to expect (key dates and milestones)  
- **Action:** What you need to do (clear call to action if relevant); where to find resources & raise questions / share feedback  

[Examples]

### Channels & Tactics
- [Decide on approach – add sections for key channels in main handbook (see doc “2- IC Handbook Draft v1 by Kar) or add brief WRI-specific definitions here and build out separate appendixes or standalone resources] 

### Tracking Success
-[ Need to build out metrics section – quantitative and qualitative]
- Basic engagement metrics: ContactMonkey open/click/read; Banyan traffic; staff meeting attendance, Stream views, etc. 
- Limitations of data and drawing insights from trends
- Importance of soft metrics
- Types of feedback channels (e.g. post implementation survey)

### Feedback Opportunities
- MAYBE SEPARATE SECTION on creating feedback opportunities (e.g. dedicated IC survey) leveraging existing feedback loops (e.g. engagement pulse, culture survey, Staff Assembly town halls, and role of listening in internal comms
